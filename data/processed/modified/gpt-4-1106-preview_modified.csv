"Mr. Scott's dog Smart was so trained, that he would never frighten the sheep. In driving a flock from one pasture to another, the sheep would often take a wrong turn, and then scamper off as fast as they could go.
At such times it is the custom of shepherds to send a dog after them at the top of his speed. He is not long in overtaking them, when, if the weather be warm, and the lanes narrow and dusty, the sheep are much frightened, and not infrequently are hurt.
Now, to prevent this, Mr. Scott would order his dog Smart to go the other side of the hedge or fence, saying, ""Now, go ahead, and bring them back, and take care not to frighten them.""
Smart would trot off so that the sheep should not see him, and in a short time would peep over or through the hedge. At length, when he had satisfied himself that he had got ahead of the sheep, he would come out gently in advance of them, and drive them back down the lane so quietly as not to give them the least alarm.","Mr. Scott had trained his dog Smart so well that he never scared the sheep. When moving sheep to a different field, they sometimes went the wrong way and ran off quickly. Usually, shepherds send a dog to chase them at full speed. The dog catches up fast, but if it's hot and the paths are tight and dusty, the sheep get really scared and might even get hurt.

To avoid this, Mr. Scott had a different approach. He would tell Smart to sneak around the other side of the hedge or fence and say, ""Now, go ahead, bring them back, but don't scare them."" Smart would quietly go around so the sheep couldn't see him. After a while, he would peek over or through the hedge. Once he was sure he was in front of the sheep, he would step out calmly in front of them and guide them back down the path without alarming them at all.",easier

In the process of translocating a congregation of sheep from one grazing domain to an alternate, it was not uncommon for the flock to inadvertently select an erroneous trajectory, subsequently engaging in a precipitous flight.

In such instances, it is entrenched in pastoral tradition to dispatch a hound in fervent pursuit. The quadruped is scarcely delayed in surmounting the distance to the flock, whereupon, under the duress of elevated temperatures, constricted byways, and an abundance of particulate matter, the sheep experience a significant degree of consternation, with injuries occurring with nontrivial frequency.

To obviate such undesirable outcomes, Mr. Scott would issue a directive to his dog Smart to navigate the opposite side of the vegetative barrier or partition, articulating, ""Proceed forthwith, effectuate their retrieval, and exercise vigilance to eschew the induction of fear.""

"Impeachment is a process in which an official is accused of unlawful activity, the outcome of which, depending on the country, may include the removal of that official from office as well as criminal or civil punishment.The word ""impeachment"" derives from Latin root impedicare expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrapped, and has analogues in the modern French verb empêcher (to prevent) and the modern English impede. Medieval popular etymology also associated it (wrongly) with derivations from the Latin impetere (to attack). (In its more frequent and more technical usage, impeachment of a witness means challenging the honesty or credibility of that person.)
Impeachment was first used in the British political system. Specifically, the process was first used by the English ""Good Parliament"" against Baron Latimer in the second half of the 14th century. Following the British example, the constitutions of Virginia (1776), Massachusetts (1780) and other states thereafter adopted the impeachment mechanism; however, they restricted the punishment to removal of the official from office. In private organizations, a motion to impeach can be used to prefer charges.","Impeachment is when an official is charged with illegal actions. Depending on the country, this can lead to them being kicked out of office and possibly facing criminal or civil penalties. The term ""impeachment"" comes from a Latin word meaning to get caught or trapped. It's related to the French word ""empêcher"" (to prevent) and the English word ""impede."" In the past, people mistakenly thought it came from a Latin word meaning ""to attack."" When talking about witnesses, ""impeachment"" can also mean questioning their truthfulness or reliability.

The British political system was the first to use impeachment. The ""Good Parliament"" of England first did this to Baron Latimer in the late 14th century. Taking a cue from Britain, the state constitutions of Virginia in 1776 and Massachusetts in 1780, among others, included impeachment. However, they only allowed for the removal of the official from their position. In private groups, a motion to impeach can be made to bring charges against someone.",easier

The etymology of ""impeachment"" can be traced to the Latin root 'impedicare', signifying the notion of becoming ensnared or entangled, and possesses cognates in contemporary French with the verb 'empêcher' (to thwart) and in present-day English with 'impede'. Medieval conjectural etymology erroneously linked it with derivations from the Latin 'impetere' (to assail).

The inception of impeachment within the British political framework is noteworthy. Explicitly, the inaugural utilization of this process by the English ""Good Parliament"" was directed at Baron Latimer during the latter moiety of the 14th century.

Aquatic resources requisite for such endeavors may be procured via the mechanical elevation from fluvial bodies, lacustrine basins both naturally occurring and those resultant from anthropogenic barriers, subterranean aquifers, or by harnessing gravitational forces to propel the liquid through conduits or unenclosed watercourses.

The aforementioned hydration may be disseminated above the photosynthetic organisms utilizing mechanized aspersers that forcibly eject H2O, or through manual vessels designed for irrigation. Within the domain of asperser-based hydration systems, H2O is conveyed via tubular structures to strategically dispersed aspersers. A central pivot hydration system exemplifies this genre. Conversely, in the drip hydration methodology, aqueous delivery is achieved through tubular conduits equipped with diminutive apertures or specialized emission devices arrayed at intervals.

"Eating healthy foods throughout our lives helps us to keep our bodies and minds strong, to live long healthy lives, and to prevent diseases. But how and why do we know what foods to eat most? To guide us, scientists, governments, and other experts do a step-by-step review of the scientific evidence about food and health to develop dietary guidelines. Dietary guidelines provide us with advice on healthy eating. We can think of foods as delivery trucks that are filled with nutrients to deliver to our bodies. Nutrients are elements in foods that our bodies use to function. There are two groups of nutrients in foods, macronutrients, and micronutrients. Macronutrients, including carbohydrates, protein, and fats, are the main components of foods and provide energy for us to move and function. Micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, calcium and iron, are elements that our bodies need in small amounts for healthy growth and development. If our bodies do not get enough nutrients, we could get sick and develop diseases. The amounts of nutrients that our bodies need can be different depending on our activity level and age.","Ingesting nutritive sustenance persistently throughout the span of our existence augments the robustness of our corporeal and cerebral structures, prolongs the duration of our vitality in a salubrious state, and acts as a bulwark against the onset of pathological conditions. Yet, the interrogation arises regarding the methodology and rationale behind our cognizance of the quintessential edibles to prioritize in consumption. To navigate this conundrum, a consortium of savants, bureaucratic entities, and additional cognoscenti undertake a methodical examination of the empirical data correlating alimentation and well-being, thereby formulating alimentary directives. These alimentary directives furnish us with counsel pertaining to salubrious nourishment. Conceptualize edibles as conveyance mechanisms, analogous to freight carriers, laden with nutriments destined for delivery to our physiological entities. Nutriments constitute the components within victuals that our organisms exploit for operational purposes. Within the realm of nutriments, there exists a bifurcation into two distinct classifications: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients encompass carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, which are the principal constituents",harder

These include drugs that dissolve the clot causing the blockage. Sometimes, doctors might use a surgical procedure to insert a wire into the blood vessel and pull out the clot.

On the other hand, if the scan reveals bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke), the treatment focuses on stopping the bleed and lowering the pressure inside the head.

The external segment, conspicuously observable and singular in its visibility, functions predominantly as an acoustic conduit, channeling ambient sonorities into the auditory meatus. Subsequent to this initial auditory capture, acoustic waves proceed into the intermediary chamber, therein inducing oscillatory phenomena within the tympanic membrane and a triad of diminutive ossicular structures, denominated the malleus, incus, and stapes, which serve to propagate acoustic energetics into the labyrinthine recesses of the internal ear. This vibrational energy perpetuates its journey to the cochlear domain, a helical structure reminiscent of a gastropod's shell, housing the Organ of Corti, replete with sensory cilia capable of detecting the aforementioned acoustic energy. Upon the cochlea's reception of sonority, it escalates the signal apprehended by these ciliated sensors and dispatches the amplified impulse via the auditory nerve to the encephalic mass.

While the auditory apparatuses are instrumental",harder
"At a recent meeting of the London Physical Society, Prof. Rowland, of Baltimore, exhibited a number of his new concave gratings for giving a diffraction spectrum. He explained the theory of their action. Gratings can be ruled on any surface, if the lines are at a proper distance apart and of the proper form. The best surface, however, is a cylindrical or spherical one. The gratings are solid slabs of polished speculum metal ruled with lines equidistant by a special machine of Prof. Rowland's invention. An account of this machine will be published shortly. The number of lines per inch varied in the specimens shown from 5,000 to 42,000, but higher numbers can be engraved by the cutting diamond. The author has designed an ingenious mechanical arrangement for keeping the photographic plates in focus. In this way photographs of great distinctness can be obtained. Prof. Rowland exhibited some 10 inches long, which showed the E line doubled, and the large B group very clearly.","At a recent gathering of the London Physical Society, Professor Rowland from Baltimore presented several of his innovative concave gratings, which are used to create a diffraction spectrum. He shared how they work. You can make gratings on any surface by etching evenly spaced, properly shaped lines. But the best results come from using a curved surface, like a cylinder or sphere. These gratings are made from shiny, mirror-like metal and have lines that are spaced out evenly, thanks to a special device that Professor Rowland invented. He's going to publish details about this device soon. The examples he showed had between 5,000 and 42,000 lines per inch, although it's possible to etch even more lines with a special diamond tool. Professor Rowland has also cleverly designed a system to keep photographic plates focused, allowing for very sharp photos. He showed off some photos that were 10 inches long, where you could see the 'E' line appear as a double, and the big 'B' group was very clear.",easier

"A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity. LEDs last a long time and do not break easily (compared to incandescent lightbulbs). They can produce many different colors. They are efficient - most of the energy makes light, not heat.
An LED is a type of diode that makes one color of light when electricity is sent through it in the expected direction (electrically biased in the forward direction). This effect is a kind of electroluminescence.
The color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconducting material used, and can be near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared. The color affects how much electricity is used by the LED. A white LED has either two or three LEDs inside, of different colors. Some white LEDs have one single-color LED inside, combined with a phosphor that converts that single color to white.","An LED, or light-emitting diode, is a small gadget that turns electricity into light. They're tough, long-lasting, and don't break as easily as old-fashioned light bulbs. Plus, they come in a rainbow of colors and are super-efficient, meaning they mostly produce light, not heat.

When you send electricity through an LED the right way, it glows in a specific color. This happens because of something called electroluminescence.

The exact color an LED shines depends on the materials it's made from. It can glow in almost invisible ultraviolet, in the colors we see, or even in infrared, which we can't see. The color also plays a role in how much power the LED uses. White LEDs are special; they can have two or three different colored LEDs inside them or just one color LED paired with a special material called a phosphor that changes the color to white.",easier

"Edith was four years old, and had come the day before, for the first time in her life, to stay on a large farm. She had never seen young chickens, except in picture-books: so you can imagine how pleased she was at the thought of seeing real live ones.
She was soon in the farmyard, and after feeding the little things with meal and water,—hasty-pudding she called it,—she seemed to long so to pet them, that her kind grandmother said, ""Well, dear, hold up your apron, and I will put some of the chickens in; but you must handle them very gently.""
Edith was delighted, and begged to carry them into the house for mamma to see. Old mother-hen, who was busy scratching for the rest of her brood, did not at first notice what was going on.

Posthaste, she found herself ensconced within the precincts of the farmstead's courtyard, whereupon she engaged in the provision of sustenance to the diminutive avians, comprising a concoction of milled grain and liquid sustenance—a substance she whimsically denominated as 'hasty-pudding'.

"The Grandcourt match was the only match of the season which Templeton played away from home. All its other matches, the house match, and even the match against the town, were played in the Fields, in the presence of the whole school. But once every other year, Templeton went forth to war in drags and omnibuses against its hereditary rival, and mighty was the excitement with which the expedition and its equipment were regarded by every boy who had the glory of his school at heart.
Seventy boys, and seventy only, were permitted to form the invading army, the selection of whom was a matter of intrigue and emulation for weeks beforehand. But for a few broad rules, which eliminated at least half the school, the task might have been still more difficult than it was. For instance, all juniors, to the eternal wrath and indignation of the Den, were excluded.","The Grandcourt engagement represented the singular instance within the annual cycle wherein Templeton ventured beyond its customary confines for competitive endeavors. Its array of other contests, inclusive of the domestic house skirmishes and even the bout opposing the local municipality, were uniformly conducted within the Fields, under the collective scrutiny of the entire scholastic assembly. Yet biennially, Templeton would sally forth, embarking upon martial campaigns via charabancs and omnibuses to engage its ancestral adversary, and prodigious was the fervor with which this sortie and its logistical preparations were contemplated by each pupil whose fervent aspirations lay with the eminence of his educational institution.

"We have frequent inquiries as to the best means of removing a gelatino-bromide negative from its glass support so that it can be used either as a direct or reversed negative, and it does not appear to be very generally known that about two years ago Mr. Plener described a method which answers well under all circumstances, whether a substratum has been used or not.
If a negative is immersed in extremely dilute hydrofluoric acid contained in an ebonite dish, say half a teaspoonful to half a pint of water, the film very soon becomes loosened, and floats off the glass, this circumstance being due to the solvent action which the acid exercises upon the surface of the plate as soon as it has penetrated the film. If the floating film be now caught upon a plate which has been slightly waxed, and it is allowed to dry on this plate, it will become quite flat and free from wrinkles. To wax the plate, it should be held before the fire until it is moderately hot, after which it is rubbed over with a lump of wax, and the excess is polished off with a piece of flannel.","We often get asked how to best remove a gelatin-bromide photographic negative from its glass base to use it normally or flipped. It seems not many know that Mr. Plener, about two years ago, shared a good method that works whether you've used an extra layer or not.

If you put a negative in a very weak solution of hydrofluoric acid, like half a teaspoon in half a pint of water, in a rubber-like dish, the negative will soon detach and float off the glass. This happens because the acid dissolves the glass surface just under the film. If you then lift the film onto a slightly waxed plate and let it dry there, it will dry smooth and without any creases. To wax the plate, warm it up in front of a fire, rub a piece of wax on it, and then polish off any extra wax with a soft cloth.",easier

Submerging the negative in a solution of hydrofluoric acid of extreme dilution, contained within a vessel of ebonite composition—proportionally, a minuscule half-measure of a teaspoon to a demi-pint of aqua—the emulsion promptly exhibits detachment, buoyantly separating from the glass, an eventuality attributable to the corrosive influence exerted by the acid upon the glass's exterior subsequent to its infiltration through the emulsion.

"According to the Greek engineer, there were several kinds of puppet shows. The oldest and simplest consisted of a small stationary case, isolated on every side, in which the stage was closed by doors that opened automatically several times to exhibit the different tableaux.

The door having been closed, and then opened again, there was seen, instead of the head, a group of persons. Finally, the stage opened a third time to show a new group, and this finished the representation. There were, then, only three movements to be made, that of the doors, that of the eyes, and that of the change of background.
As such representations were often given on the stages of large theaters, a method was devised later on of causing the case to start from the scenes behind which it was bidden from the spectators, and of moving automatically to the front of the stage, where it exhibited in succession the different tableaux; after which it returned automatically behind the scenes.","The Greek engineer explained that there were various types of puppet shows. The earliest and simplest form was a small, enclosed box that stood alone. The front had doors that would open by themselves to show different scenes. Typically, the show would go like this: First, you'd see a painted head on the back wall of the box, which could move and blink its eyes. After the doors shut and reopened, the head would be replaced by a scene with several characters. The doors would close and open one last time to reveal a new scene with different characters, and that was the end of the show. There were just three things that needed to move: the doors, the eyes, and the scenes.

These shows were also performed in big theaters. To make things more interesting, they came up with a way to move the box from behind the stage, out of the audience's view, to the front.

The most archaic and unadorned of these spectacles comprised a diminutive, immobile receptacle, ensconced in solitude, bounded on all flanks, wherein the proscenium was occluded by portals that autonomously swung asunder multiple junctures to unveil disparate dioramas. The itinerary of the dramaturgy typically unfolded thusly: The inaugural diorama presented a visage, delineated upon the posterior of the proscenium, which executed ocular gyrations, and sequentially depressed and elevated them. Subsequent to the occlusion of the portals, and their ensuing retraction, there materialized, in lieu of the visage, an assemblage of entities. Ultimately, the proscenium was once more agape to reveal an additional assemblage, culminating the theatricals. There were, hence, a mere triad of maneuvers required: that of the portals, that of the ocular movements, and that of the scenic metamorphoses.

Censure of it, from me especially, is not the thing due; from me a far other thing is due!","Notwithstanding the veracity potentially inherent within these fervent expositions, and notwithstanding the acute personal consciousness of their veracity I harbored, it remained an enigma as to the manner in which any confidant of Sterling's, particularly one entwined in the affair as intimately as I, might endeavor to proffer assistance or devise a palliative in the interim. Could one, perchance, simply persevere in stoicism until such time as the tumult subsided of its own volition, as all tumult inevitably does when left undisturbed? A considerable degree of obfuscation would, in due course, dissipate autonomously; and within the corpus of Mr. Hare's chronicle, if one were to extricate the raw data from his interpretive discourse, a plethora of attributes emblematic of Sterling's authentic persona would manifest to the assiduous inquirer. To cast aspersions upon, or to levy criticism against, Mr. Hare's literary endeavor was decidedly antithetical to my disposition.

"Surround sound is a technique for enriching the sound reproduction quality of an audio source with additional audio channels from speakers that surround the listener (surround channels), providing sound from a 360° radius in the horizontal plane (2D) as opposed to ""screen channels"" (centre, left, and right) originating only from the listener's forward arc.
Surround sound is characterized by a listener location or sweet spot where the audio effects work best, and presents a fixed or forward perspective of the sound field to the listener at this location. The technique enhances the perception of sound spatialization by exploiting sound localization; a listener's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance. Typically this is achieved by using multiple discrete audio channels routed to an array of loudspeakers.
There are various surround sound based formats and techniques, varying in reproduction and recording methods along with the number and positioning of additional channels.","Surround sound is a way to improve how we hear audio by using extra speakers around the listener. These speakers create sound from all around, giving a full 360-degree experience, unlike regular speakers that only send sound from in front of you.

"M. Leclerc du Sablon has published some of his results in his work on the opening of fruits. The influences which act upon fruit are external and internal. The external cause of dehiscence is drying. We can open or shut a fruit by drying or wetting it. The internal causes are related to the arrangement of the tissues, and we may say that the opening of fruit can be easily explained by the contraction of the ligneous fibers under drying influences. M. Leclerc shows by experiment that the fibers contract more transversely than longitudinally, and that the thicker fibers contract the most. This he finds is connected with the opening of dry fruits.
Herr Hoffman has recently made some interesting experiments upon the cultivation of fruits.
It is well known that many plants appear to select certain mineral soils and avoid others, that a number of plants which prefer calcareous soils are grouped together as calcicoles, and others which shun such ground as calcifuges.

There are outside and inside factors that affect this. The main outside reason fruits split open is because they dry out. We can make a fruit open or close by either drying it out or making it wet. Inside, it's about how the fruit's parts are put together. Basically, the opening of fruit is due to the wood-like fibers shrinking when they dry. M. Leclerc's experiments show that these fibers shrink more across their width than their length, and the thicker the fiber, the more it shrinks. He links this to why dry fruits open up.

Herr Hoffman has also been doing some fascinating work with growing fruits. It's a common fact that many plants pick certain types of soil with minerals and avoid others. For example, plants that like lime-rich soils are called calcicoles, and those that don't are known as calcifuges. Herr Hoffman has successfully grown a plant that many experts thought couldn't grow in lime-rich soil.",easier
"M. Leclerc du Sablon has published some of his results in his work on the opening of fruits. The influences which act upon fruit are external and internal. The external cause of dehiscence is drying. We can open or shut a fruit by drying or wetting it. The internal causes are related to the arrangement of the tissues, and we may say that the opening of fruit can be easily explained by the contraction of the ligneous fibers under drying influences. M. Leclerc shows by experiment that the fibers contract more transversely than longitudinally, and that the thicker fibers contract the most. This he finds is connected with the opening of dry fruits.
Herr Hoffman has recently made some interesting experiments upon the cultivation of fruits.
It is well known that many plants appear to select certain mineral soils and avoid others, that a number of plants which prefer calcareous soils are grouped together as calcicoles, and others which shun such ground as calcifuges. Herr Hoffman has grown the specimen which has been cited by many authors as absolutely calcifugic.","Monsieur Leclerc du Sablon's scholarly treatise delineates his investigative findings pertaining to the mechanisms underlying the dehiscence of fruiting bodies. The causative agents influencing such phenomena are bifurcated into exogenous and endogenous factors. The predominant exogenous catalyst for dehiscence is the desiccation process. Through empirical manipulation of hydration levels, one can induce or inhibit the opening of a fruit. Endogenously, the phenomena are intricately linked to the spatial configuration of the cellular matrices, and it is postulated that the dehiscence of fruits is readily explicable via the desiccation-induced contraction of the xylary fibers. Monsieur Leclerc's experimental data corroborates the hypothesis that these fibers exhibit a greater degree of contraction in the transverse plane as opposed to the longitudinal axis, with the contraction being most pronounced in fibers of increased girth. This particular dynamic is posited to be integral to the dehiscence of xerophytic fruiting entities.
Concurrently, Herr Hoffman has been engrossed in conducting a series of compelling experimental",harder
"Pappenheim divides the diseases of the cereals into two classes, internal and external. The internal diseases are those depending upon conditions of soil, climate, cultivation, etc., and may be neglected in our discussion, as they produce no special disease of the body, only impairing the nutritive value of the grain.
The external diseases are of much greater importance, as they probably produce some of the most fatal maladies to which the human race is subject. These external diseases of the cereals are due to parasites, which may be either of an animal or vegetable nature. Among the animal parasites may be mentioned the weevil, vibrio tritici, which feeds upon the starch cells of the grain. Grain attacked by this parasite was at one time supposed to be injurious to health.
In 1844 the French Commission appointed to examine grain condemned a large quantity imported with this parasite, but afterward reconsidered their decision and permitted its sale, concluding that it was deficient in nutritive properties, but not otherwise unwholesome. Rust is the most common disease of the cereals, produced by vegetable parasites. Like the other diseases of this class, it is most prevalent in warm, damp seasons.","Pappenheim categorizes cereal diseases into two types: internal and external. Internal diseases come from the soil, weather, and farming methods. We won't focus on these because they don't cause specific illnesses, they just lower the grain's nutritional value.

External diseases, on the other hand, are more serious. They can lead to deadly diseases in people. These are caused by parasites, which can be tiny animals or plants. For example, the weevil, known as vibrio tritici, eats the starch inside the grain. There was a time when people thought grain with this bug was harmful.

In 1844, a French group checked some imported grain with these weevils and rejected it. But later, they changed their minds and allowed it to be sold. They decided the grain wasn't harmful, just less nutritious. The most common cereal disease is rust, caused by plant parasites. It happens a lot in warm, wet weather.",easier

The intrinsic malaises are resultant from a confluence of edaphic factors, meteorological conditions, and agricultural methodologies, etc., and may be eschewed in our exegesis, as their manifestation yields no distinct pathology within the corporeal entity, merely attenuating the alimentary worth of the caryopsis. 
Conversely, the extrinsic malaises hold paramount significance, as they ostensibly engender some of the most lethal afflictions besetting mankind. These extrinsic pathologies of cereals emanate from parasitic entities, which may be categorized under zoological or botanical paradigms. Amongst the zoological parasites, one might cite the granary weevil, vibrio tritici, a consumer of the amylaceous cellular structures within the grain.

The impossibility of increasing the indirect taxation is bringing about the increase of direct taxes, and therefore makes the burden on the Ottoman tax-payers all the heavier. The fact that foreigners who enjoy in the Ottoman Empire every protection and every privilege as well as freedom in their business transactions are exempt from taxation constitutes in itself an intolerable injustice and creates at the same time a situation detrimental to the independence and prestige of the Government. While the Imperial Government was firm in its resolution to continue its efforts regarding the reforms, the general war broke and increased the financial difficulties of the country in such a degree that all the innovations and all the reforms which have been decided upon and actually begun are threatened to remain without effect.","Looking at it another way, foreigners who live in the Ottoman Empire don't have to pay taxes because of special agreements called capitulations. This means the Ottoman government, also known as the Sublime Porte, can't get the money it desperately needs for reforms or even its day-to-day operations. Since they can't raise money through indirect taxes, they have to increase direct taxes, which puts a lot more pressure on the people of the Ottoman Empire who do pay taxes. It's really unfair that foreigners get all the benefits and freedoms in their businesses without paying any taxes. This not only causes a big injustice but also weakens the government's authority and independence. The government wanted to keep working on reforms, but then a huge war started, making the country's money problems even worse. This has put all the planned and started reforms at risk of not being completed.",easier

The incapacity to amplify the indirect fiscal impositions is precipitating an escalation in the direct levies, thereby exacerbating the fiscal encumbrance upon the Ottoman contributors to an even more onerous extent. The reality that aliens, who partake in the Ottoman Empire of every conceivable safeguard and privilege, in addition to unbridled liberty in their mercantile engagements, are liberated from the obligation of taxation, epitomizes an egregious inequity and concurrently engenders a predicament that is inimical to the sovereignty and esteem of the Administration.

"When you think of flamingos, you always remember their beautiful pink color. Amazingly, the birds get this color from the food they eat! Flamingos eat organisms such as plankton, shrimps, crabs and tiny water plants. All of these have special coloring agents which cause a flamingo to turn pink when it eats them.
If you take a flamingo away from its natural habitat and don't feed it these kinds of food, their color will turn whiter and whiter as days pass by. Flamingos are water birds – they live and feed near the sea coast and lakes as the food they eat is found in water. They are quite tall – some of them can grow up to a height of 1.5 meters. That is almost as tall as a human!
These birds have very long legs so they can walk far into the water. Although most photos will show you pictures of flamingos wading in the shallow water, these birds can also swim! Like other water birds such as ducks, flamingos have webbed feet. Webbed feet help birds push water back and swim across a water body.","When you picture flamingos, their striking pink color probably comes to mind. Interestingly, they get this pink hue from their diet! Flamingos munch on things like plankton, shrimp, crabs, and small aquatic plants. These foods contain special pigments that dye the flamingo pink as it eats them.

If you move a flamingo from its home and stop giving it these foods, it will gradually lose its pink color and become paler with each passing day. Flamingos are birds that love water – they hang out and eat by the sea or lakes because that's where their food is. They're pretty tall, too; some can reach 1.5 meters, nearly the height of a person!

These birds have super long legs, which let them wade deep into the water. Even though you often see pictures of flamingos in shallow water, they can actually swim! Like ducks and other waterfowl, flamingos have webbed feet. These feet act like paddles, helping them to swim through the water.",easier

Webbed feet help birds push water back and swim across a water body.","Upon contemplation of the species Phoenicopteridae, commonly referred to as flamingos, one's cognition invariably conjures the imagery of their resplendent roseate hue. It is a source of wonderment that these avians acquire their distinctive pigmentation through their dietary consumption. The flamingo's sustenance comprises a variety of aquatic entities, including but not limited to planktonic organisms, decapod crustaceans, brachyuran crabs, and diminutive hydrophytic flora. Each of these nutritive sources is imbued with chromatic compounds, which, upon ingestion, imbue the flamingo with its characteristic pinkish tint.

Extricating a flamingo from its indigenous environs and depriving it of these chromatic nutriments results in a gradual depigmentation, with the creature's plumage assuming an increasingly pallid aspect as temporal progression ensues. Flamingos are categorized as aquatic avifauna, their existence predominantly occurring proximate to saline maritime shores and lacustrine basins, given that their preferred alimentary items are procured within aqueous ecosystems. Their stature is noteworthy, with certain specimens att",harder
"When Soupramany perceived what a fine fish he had caught, he uttered one of those long, low gurgling notes of satisfaction by which an elephant expresses joy; and he waited patiently, expecting Jim to take his prize off the hook and put on some more bait for him. But Jim, the little rascal, sometimes liked to plague Old Soup. He nodded at us, as much as to say, ""Look out, and you'll see fun, now!""

Jim took the fish off the hook, tossed it into a nearby jar meant for that, and went back to his spot without rebaiting Old Soup's hook. The clever elephant didn't just cast his line back in the water. He made soft, begging noises, trying to get Jim's attention. It was interesting to see how gentle and pleading his sounds were.
